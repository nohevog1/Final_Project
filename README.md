GES 778 Final Project The goal is to be able to display this project on my website at nohemivoglozin.wix.com/nohemi-voglozin It will be about the genetic diversity of rice varieties in two ecogeographic regions in BENIN, West Africa, and how that genetic diversity is correlated:

- to the management and decisions that farmers make on their fields on a daily basis, and
- to environmental variables such as rainall, elevation, temperature, etc. 

It will also display some touristic characteristics of the country and some points of interests that are definitely worth checking out while visiting or travelling through the country.
