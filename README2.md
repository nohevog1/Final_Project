GES 778 Final Project
The goal is to be able to dsplay this project on my website at nohemivoglozin.wix.com/nohemi-voglozin
It will be about the genetic diversity of rice varieties in two ecogeographic regions in BENIN, West Africa, 
and how that genetic diversity is correlated:
- to the management and decisions that farmers make on their fields on a daily basis, and 
- to environmental variables such as rainall, elevation, temperature, etc.
It will also display some touristic characteristics of he country and some points of interests that are definitely worth checking out while visiting or trvalling through the country.
